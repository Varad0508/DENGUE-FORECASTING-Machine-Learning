# DENGUE-FORECASTING-Machine-Learning

## Dataset Story
Data has taken from drivenData.org, it was released as a part of their competition DengAI. Dataset from the competition has 2 cities named Sanjuan and Iquitos.Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease that occurs in tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world. In mild cases, symptoms are similar to the flu: fever, rash, and muscle and joint pain. In severe cases, dengue fever can cause severe bleeding, low blood pressure, and even death. Because it is carried by mosquitoes, the transmission dynamics of dengue are related to climate variables such as temperature,humidity and precipitation. An understanding of the relationship between climate and dengue dynamics can improve research initiatives and resource allocation to help fight life-threatening pandemics.

Our data contains Climatic information such as precipitation, temperature, humidity for each City and Satellite vegetation. And also, we have total cases of Dengue Affected Cases for the Corresponding Year and Week of the Year.

## Objectives(Task Definition)
1) To predict the number of dengue cases each week (in each location) based on environmental variables describing changes in temperature, precipitation and humidity?
2) To model the number of cases reported using the climate data for the two cities over the same period, so that it will be helpful in predicting the spread of this disease

Here input is the environmental variables and output is the prediction of total cases
